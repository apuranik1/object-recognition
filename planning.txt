Object recognition toolkit (training and execution)

- image_loading.py: read from files, store as array
    - include decoding outputs?
    - load_image(datastream)
    - load_from_dir(path)
    - split data into train/val


- cnn_builder.py: a module for defining the structure of the CNN itself, executing it on an image
    - Includes ObjectRecognitionCNN
    - needs to be super configurable
    - also include serialization/deserialization: save_model, load_model

- cnn_training.py: handle training and optimization (maybe this is trivial enough to fold into exec?)
    - should be able to

- cnn_exec.py: entrypoint - load using image_loading and run on imagenet set
    - function train: load images + train CNN, save model to file
    - function exec: load CNN and exec on a set of image(s?)
    - auxiliary functions:
        - measure accuracy/loss on a dataset
        - run a batch of image arrays through the network
